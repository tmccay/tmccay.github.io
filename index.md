# Tim McCay

I am an ecologist at a primarily undergraduate university, [Colgate University](www.colgate.ed). I am interested in forest-floor ecology, shrews, earthworms, and biostatistics. I am excited to up my "analytical game" at MEFA 2024!

I am associated with the BEFA (Beaver Ecology for All) project.
